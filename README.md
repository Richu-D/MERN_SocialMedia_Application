# MERN_SocialMedia_Application
I developed a social media application using the MERN stack. 
My expertise lies in integrating the various components of the MERN stack to create a seamless user experience. 
I utilized REST APIs for communication between the front-end and back-end and handled state management with tools such as the Context API, Redux. 
I have experience working with MongoDB Atlas and Mongoose to store and manage data in the back-end, and implemented secure authentication using JWT Tokens. 
I utilized various NPM packages, such as react-router-dom, moment, Axios, Nodemailer, and Formik, to enhance the functionality and user experience of the application. 
The sign-up process includes email verification, and the application features real-time chat and notifications for users. 
I have a good understanding of Axios and its functionalities, which is a critical aspect of the project.
